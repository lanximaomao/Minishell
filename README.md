<bt>

## Functionality

It minics the behavior of bash:

- Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
- Implement pipes and redirections.
- Search and launch the right executable based on the PATH variable or using a relative or an absolute path.
- Handle both single and double quotes.
- Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.


<bt>
	In interactive mode:

		- ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
		- ctrl-D exits the shell.
		- ctrl-\ does nothing.

<bt>
	It implements the following builtins:

		- echo with option -n
		- cd with only a relative or absolute path â—¦ pwd with no options
		- export with no options
		- unset with no options
		- env with no options or arguments
		- exit with no options
